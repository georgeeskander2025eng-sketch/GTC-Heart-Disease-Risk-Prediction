Heart Disease Risk Prediction
📌 Project Overview

The Heart Disease Risk Prediction project is a machine learning classification system designed to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on clinical and demographic features. The project follows a complete end-to-end data science workflow, from data exploration and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

This project was developed as part of a GTC machine learning project and demonstrates practical skills in healthcare data analysis and predictive modeling.
